# vZome PWA

This project reimagines the [vZome desktop app](desktop) as a
[progressive web application](pwa).

The project is based on the [Ionic](ionic) framework for building PWAs, using [React](react) as the component framework, with [redux-bundler](bundler) for state management,
and [react-three-fiber](r3fiber) for 3D rendering using React Fiber reconciliation.
